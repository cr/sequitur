# Sequitur

An attempt at Sequitur in python. I think it works.

You might want to try implementing it yourself in your favorite programming language. It is at the same time absolutely beautifully mind-blowing and stupefyingly humbling. It will take your relation with that language to a whole new level. Bonus points if that language is functional. In that case: also good luck!

## Usage

Currently it likes text files as input. The main loop feeds the main rule from the file character by character.

```
$ ./sqt.py sqt.py
```

It drops you in an ipython embed() session with the finished Sequitur object in s. Try:

```
print s.spell_rules()
```
